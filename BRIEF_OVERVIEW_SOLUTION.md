# PII Redaction Solution for Voice Call Metadata

## Executive Summary
This solution automates the detection and redaction of PII from voice call metadata stored in Amazon S3, enabling secure downstream analytics and insights generation while maintaining compliance with data privacy regulations.

## Problem Statement
- Manual call review process is time-consuming and limits scalability
- ~30-60 JSON files daily with ~15,000 payloads each require processing
- PII in transcripts poses compliance and privacy risks
- Difficulty extracting insights from large-scale conversation data
