# PII Redaction Agent. "I tried to organize this. Please look in all the appropriate directories to find directions, explanations, code/scripts and diagrams. You can even run this yourself but I tested this plenty of times."


A serverless AWS-based system for automatically detecting and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from JSON verbatim data using AWS Comprehend, Lambda, and S3. 


## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This system automatically processes JSON files uploaded to S3, detects PII using AWS Comprehend, redacts sensitive information, and saves clean data to a separate bucket.
