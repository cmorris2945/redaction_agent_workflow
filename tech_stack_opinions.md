# Technology Justification

## AWS Lambda
**Why:** 
- Serverless compute eliminates infrastructure management
- Auto-scales to handle 30-60 files daily
- Cost-effective: pay only for processing time
- 15-minute timeout sufficient for 15,000 payloads

## Amazon S3
**Why:**
- Native integration with Lambda via event notifications
- Cost-effective storage for JSON files
- Supports partitioning (YYYY/MM/DD)
- Lifecycle policies for data retention

## Amazon Comprehend
**Why:**
- Pre-trained ML models for PII detection
- Supports 20+ PII entity types
- High accuracy (>95%)
- No ML expertise required

## CloudWatch
**Why:**
- Native integration with Lambda
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Custom metrics for business KPIs

## Alternative Considerations

### Why not Amazon Textract?
- Designed for document extraction, not PII detection
- More expensive for text-only processing

### Why not SageMaker?
- Overkill for this use case
- Requires ML expertise
- Higher operational overhead

### Why not EC2/ECS?
- Requires infrastructure management
- Less cost-effective for sporadic workloads
- Manual scaling configuration needed
